# MR+NØM Landing (Next.js + Tailwind)

A tiny Next.js project that reproduces the hero section shown in the mock.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — you should see the exact layout.

## Notes
- App Router (Next 14) + Tailwind 3
- Fonts use system stack for simplicity.
- The two grayscale images reuse an included placeholder (`public/images/dj1.jpg` and `dj2.jpg`). Replace them with your own.
